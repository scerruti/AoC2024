# Advent of Code 2024 for AP Computer Science A

Please see [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) for information about the programming challenges, leaderboards and stats.

## Goal

Each year I attempt to solve the Advent of Code using the AP CSA subset and write up my responses for the benefit of anyone who might want to try to use them as an extension in class.

[AP Computer Science Java Subset](https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/RQcHGkgynkYDYamVak9DP)

I make every attempt to note where I have gone outside the lines. This year I will be noting where I deviate from the _Tested in the AP CS A Exam_ but I will not be limiting myself to the very strictest subset but will include information from _Not Tested in the AP CS A Exam but potentially relevant/useful_.

## Write Ups
